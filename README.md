# Simulation-of-Air-conditioning-processes-in-HVAC-systems
In this project, a set of scripts is implemented for performing the calculations of air-conditioning processes that take place in HVAC systems. These calculations include: 1) Mixing process  2) Coil load calculation, given the supply conditions  3) Coil load calculations, given the roomâ€™s sensible and latent load along with the recirculation rate.
